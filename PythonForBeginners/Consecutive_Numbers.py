# No one likes homework, but your math teacher has given you an assignment to find the sum of the first N numbers.
# Letâ€™s save some time by creating a program to do the calculation for you!
# Take a number N as input and output the sum of all numbers from 1 to N (including N).
# Sample Input
# 100
# Sample Output
# 5050
# Explanation: The sum of all numbers from 1 to 100 is equal to 5050.
